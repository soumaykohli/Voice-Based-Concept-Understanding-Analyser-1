# 🎤 Voice-Based Concept Understanding Analyser (VBCUA)

An AI-powered educational web application that evaluates a student's conceptual understanding from spoken explanations using speech recognition, semantic similarity analysis, and audio feature extraction.

---

# 📌 Project Overview

The **Voice-Based Concept Understanding Analyser (VBCUA)** is designed to assess a student's conceptual understanding through spoken explanations rather than written responses.

The application combines **OpenAI Whisper**, **Sentence-BERT**, and **Librosa** to automatically transcribe speech, compare it with a reference concept, analyze communication quality, and generate an intelligent evaluation report.

The system provides an objective assessment by combining semantic understanding and speech characteristics.

# 📋 Application Workflow

1. Launch the Streamlit application.
2. Enter the reference concept.
3. Upload a student's audio explanation.
4. Convert speech into text using Whisper.
5. Generate sentence embeddings using Sentence-BERT.
6. Compute semantic similarity.
7. Extract audio features using Librosa.
8. Detect filler words.
9. Calculate the understanding score.
10. Generate qualitative feedback.
11. Download the evaluation report as a PDF.

# 📊 Evaluation Metrics

The application evaluates spoken explanations using multiple criteria.

| Metric | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Semantic Similarity | Measures conceptual alignment with the reference answer |
| Filler Word Ratio | Measures unnecessary filler words |
| Pause Ratio | Measures speaking continuity |
| RMS Energy | Estimates speaking confidence |
| Understanding Score | Overall evaluation score |
| Classification | Strong / Moderate / Poor Understanding |
